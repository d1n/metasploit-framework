## Multi Recon Local Exploit Suggester

This module suggests local meterpreter exploits that can be 
used. The exploits are suggested based on the architecture 
and platform that the user has a shell opened as well as the 
available exploits in meterpreter. It's important to note 
that not all local exploits will be fired. Exploits are 
chosen based on these conditions: session type, platform, 
architecture, and required default options.
