## PXE Boot Exploit Server

This module provides a PXE server, running a DHCP and TFTP 
server. The default configuration loads a linux kernel and 
initrd into memory that reads the hard drive; placing a 
payload to install metsvc, disable the firewall, and add a 
new user metasploit on any Windows partition seen, and add a 
uid 0 user with username and password metasploit to any 
linux partition seen. The windows user will have the 
password p@SSw0rd!123456 (in case of complexity 
requirements) and will be added to the administrators group. 
Note: the displayed IP address of a target is the address 
this DHCP server handed out, not the "normal" IP address the 
host uses.
