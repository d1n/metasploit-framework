## SysAid Help Desk Administrator Portal Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid 
Help Desk. The vulnerability exists in the ChangePhoto.jsp 
in the administrator portal, which does not correctly handle 
directory traversal sequences and does not enforce file 
extension restrictions. While an attacker needs an 
administrator account in order to leverage this 
vulnerability, there is a related Metasploit auxiliary 
module which can create this account under some 
circumstances. This module has been tested in SysAid v14.4 
in both Linux and Windows.
