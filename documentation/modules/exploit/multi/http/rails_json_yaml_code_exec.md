## Ruby on Rails JSON Processor YAML Deserialization Code Execution

This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability 
in the JSON request processor of the Ruby on Rails 
application framework. This vulnerability allows an attacker 
to instantiate a remote object, which in turn can be used to 
execute any ruby code remotely in the context of the 
application. This vulnerability is very similar to 
CVE-2013-0156. This module has been tested successfully on 
RoR 3.0.9, 3.0.19, and 2.3.15. The technique used by this 
module requires the target to be running a fairly recent 
version of Ruby 1.9 (since 2011 or so). Applications using 
Ruby 1.8 may still be exploitable using the init_with() 
method, but this has not been demonstrated.
