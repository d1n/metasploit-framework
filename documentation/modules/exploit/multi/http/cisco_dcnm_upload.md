## Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a code execution flaw in Cisco Data 
Center Network Manager. The vulnerability exists in 
processImageSave.jsp, which can be abused through a 
directory traversal and a null byte injection to upload 
arbitrary files. The autodeploy JBoss application server 
feature is used to achieve remote code execution. This 
module has been tested successfully on Cisco Prime Data 
Center Network Manager 6.1(2) on Windows 2008 R2 (64 bits).
