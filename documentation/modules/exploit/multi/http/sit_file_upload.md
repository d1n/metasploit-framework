## Support Incident Tracker Remote Command Execution

This module combines two separate issues within Support 
Incident Tracker (<= 3.65) application to upload arbitrary 
data and thus execute a shell. The two issues exist in 
ftp_upload_file.php. The first vulnerability exposes the 
upload dir used to store attachments. The second 
vulnerability allows arbitrary file upload since there is no 
validation function to prevent from uploading any file type. 
Authentication is required to exploit both vulnerabilities.
