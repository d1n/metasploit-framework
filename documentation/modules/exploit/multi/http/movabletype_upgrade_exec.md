## Movable Type 4.2x, 4.3x Web Upgrade Remote Code Execution

This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType 
(MT) that exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at 
/mt/mt-upgrade.cgi), that is used during installation and 
updating of the platform. The vulnerability arises due to 
the following properties: 1. This script may be invoked 
remotely without requiring authentication to any MT 
instance. 2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible 
to invoke particular database migration functions (i.e 
functions that bring the existing database up-to-date with 
an updated codebase) by name and with particular parameters. 
3. A particular migration function, 
core_drop_meta_for_table, allows a class parameter to be set 
which is used directly in a perl eval statement, allowing 
perl code injection.
