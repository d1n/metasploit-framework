## Sun/Oracle GlassFish Server Authenticated Code Execution

This module logs in to an GlassFish Server (Open Source or 
Commercial) using various methods (such as authentication 
bypass, default credentials, or user-supplied login), and 
deploys a malicious war file in order to get remote code 
execution. It has been tested on Glassfish 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and 
Sun Java System Application Server 9.x. Newer GlassFish 
versions do not allow remote access (Secure Admin) by 
default, but is required for exploitation.
