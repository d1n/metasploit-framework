## Sun Java System Web Server WebDAV OPTIONS Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Sun Java Web 
Server prior to version 7 Update 8. By sending an "OPTIONS" 
request with an overly long path, attackers can execute 
arbitrary code. In order to reach the vulnerable code, the 
attacker must also specify the path to a directory with 
WebDAV enabled. This exploit was tested and confirmed to 
work on Windows XP SP3 without DEP. Versions for other 
platforms are vulnerable as well. The vulnerability was 
originally discovered and disclosed by Evgeny Legerov of 
Intevydis.
