## PHP Volunteer Management System v1.0.2 Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability found in PHP Volunteer 
Management System, version v1.0.2 or prior. This application 
has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user to 
upload anything to the 'uploads' directory, which is 
actually reachable by anyone without a credential. An 
attacker can easily abuse this upload functionality first by 
logging in with the default credential (admin:volunteer), 
upload a malicious payload, and then execute it by sending 
another GET request.
