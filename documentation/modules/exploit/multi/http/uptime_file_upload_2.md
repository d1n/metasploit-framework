## Idera Up.Time Monitoring Station 7.4 post2file.php Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Uptime version 
7.4.0 and 7.5.0. The vulnerability began as a classic 
arbitrary file upload vulnerability in post2file.php, which 
can be exploited by 
exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1.rb, but it was 
mitigated by the vendor. Although the mitigiation in place 
will prevent uptime_file_upload_1.rb from working, it can 
still be bypassed and gain privilege escalation, and allows 
the attacker to upload file again, and execute arbitrary 
commands.
