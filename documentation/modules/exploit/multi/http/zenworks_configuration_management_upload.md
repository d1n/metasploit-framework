## Novell ZENworks Configuration Management Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Novell 
ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM, which is part of the 
ZENworks Suite). The vulnerability exists in the 
UploadServlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and 
does not check the "uid" parameter for directory traversal 
characters. This allows an attacker to write anywhere in the 
file system, and can be abused to deploy a WAR file in the 
Tomcat webapps directory. ZCM up to (and including) 11.3.1 
is vulnerable to this attack. This module has been tested 
successfully with ZCM 11.3.1 on Windows and Linux. Note that 
this is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 / OSVDB-63412 
which also has a Metasploit exploit, but it abuses a 
different parameter of the same servlet.
