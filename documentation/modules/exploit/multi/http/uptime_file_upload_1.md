## Idera Up.Time Monitoring Station 7.0 post2file.php Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability 
found within the Up.Time monitoring server 7.2 and below. A 
malicious entity can upload a PHP file into the webroot 
without authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution. 
Although the vendor fixed Up.Time to prevent this 
vulnerability, it was not properly mitigated. To exploit 
against a newer version of Up.Time (such as 7.4), please use 
exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_2.
