## SonicWALL GMS 6 Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a code execution flaw in SonicWALL GMS. 
It exploits two vulnerabilities in order to get its 
objective. An authentication bypass in the Web 
Administration interface allows to abuse the "appliance" 
application and upload an arbitrary payload embedded in a 
JSP. The module has been tested successfully on SonicWALL 
GMS 6.0.6017 over Windows 2003 SP2 and SonicWALL GMS 
6.0.6022 Virtual Appliance (Linux). On the Virtual Appliance 
the linux meterpreter hasn't run successfully while testing, 
shell payload have been used.
