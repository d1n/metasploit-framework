## JBoss JMX Console Deployer Upload and Execute

This module can be used to execute a payload on JBoss 
servers that have an exposed "jmx-console" application. The 
payload is put on the server by using the 
jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, 
a temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive 
containing our payload. This method will only work if the 
target server allows outbound connections to us.
