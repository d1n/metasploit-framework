## Openfire Admin Console Authentication Bypass

This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability 
in the administration console of Openfire servers. By using 
this vulnerability it is possible to upload/execute a 
malicious Openfire plugin on the server and execute 
arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested against 
Openfire 3.6.0a. It is possible to remove the uploaded 
plugin after execution, however this might turn the server 
in some kind of unstable state, making re-exploitation 
difficult. You might want to do this manually.
