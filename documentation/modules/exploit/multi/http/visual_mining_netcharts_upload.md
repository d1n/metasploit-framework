## Visual Mining NetCharts Server Remote Code Execution

This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Visual 
Mining NetCharts. First, a lack of input validation in the 
administration console permits arbitrary jsp code upload to 
locations accessible later through the web service. 
Authentication is typically required, however a 'hidden' 
user is available by default (and non-editable). This user, 
named 'Scheduler', can only login to the console after any 
modification in the user database (a user is added, admin 
password is changed etc). If the 'Scheduler' user isn't 
available valid credentials must be supplied. The default 
Admin password is Admin.
