## vTiger CRM SOAP AddEmailAttachment Arbitrary File Upload

vTiger CRM allows an user to bypass authentication when 
requesting SOAP services. In addition, arbitrary file upload 
is possible through the AddEmailAttachment SOAP service. By 
combining both vulnerabilities an attacker can upload and 
execute PHP code. This module has been tested successfully 
on vTiger CRM v5.4.0 over Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows 2003 SP2.
