## ISPConfig Authenticated Arbitrary PHP Code Execution

ISPConfig allows an authenticated administrator to export 
language settings into a PHP script which is intended to be

can be abused to run aribtrary PHP code remotely on the 
ISPConfig server. This module was tested against version 
3.0.5.2.
