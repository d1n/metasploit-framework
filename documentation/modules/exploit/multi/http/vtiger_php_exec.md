## vTigerCRM v5.4.0/v5.3.0 Authenticated Remote Code Execution

vTiger CRM allows an authenticated user to upload files to 
embed within documents. Due to insufficient privileges on 
the 'files' upload folder, an attacker can upload a PHP 
script and execute aribtrary PHP code remotely. This module 
was tested against vTiger CRM v5.4.0 and v5.3.0.
