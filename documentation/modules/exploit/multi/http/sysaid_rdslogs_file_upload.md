## SysAid Help Desk 'rdslogs' Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid 
Help Desk v14.3 and v14.4. The vulnerability exists in the 
RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated file 
uploads and handles zip file contents in a insecure way. By 
combining both weaknesses, a remote attacker can accomplish 
remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the 
target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and 
above introduces a protection against null byte injection in 
file names. This module has been tested successfully on 
version v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory 
this module also works on Windows, but SysAid seems to 
bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which 
prevents the vulnerability from being exploited.
