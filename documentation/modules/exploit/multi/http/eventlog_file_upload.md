## ManageEngine Eventlog Analyzer Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in 
ManageEngine Eventlog Analyzer. The vulnerability exists in 
the agentUpload servlet which accepts unauthenticated file 
uploads and handles zip file contents in a insecure way. By 
combining both weaknesses a remote attacker can achieve 
remote code execution. This module has been tested 
successfully on versions v7.0 - v9.9 b9002 in Windows and 
Linux. Versions between 7.0 and < 8.1 are only exploitable 
via EAR deployment in the JBoss server, while versions 8.1+ 
are only exploitable via a JSP upload.
