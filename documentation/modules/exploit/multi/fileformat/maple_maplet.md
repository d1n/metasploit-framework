## Maple Maplet File Creation and Command Execution

This module harnesses Maple's ability to create files and 
execute commands automatically when opening a Maplet. All 
versions up to 13 are suspected vulnerable. Testing was 
conducted with version 13 on Windows. Standard security 
settings prevent code from running in a normal maple 
worksheet without user interaction, but those setting do not 
prevent code in a Maplet from running. In order for the 
payload to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to 
open a specially modified .maplet file with Maple. By doing 
so, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as the victim 
user.
