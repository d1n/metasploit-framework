## PeaZip Zip Processing Command Injection

This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in 
PeaZip. All versions prior to 2.6.2 are suspected 
vulnerable. Testing was conducted with version 2.6.1 on 
Windows. In order for the command to be executed, an 
attacker must convince someone to open a specially crafted 
zip file with PeaZip, and access the specially file via 
double-clicking it. By doing so, an attacker can execute 
arbitrary commands as the victim user.
