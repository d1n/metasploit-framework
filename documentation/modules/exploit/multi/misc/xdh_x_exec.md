## Xdh / LinuxNet Perlbot / fBot IRC Bot Remote Code Execution

This module allows remote command execution on an IRC Bot 
developed by xdh. This perl bot was caught by Conor Patrick 
with his shellshock honeypot server and is categorized by 
Markus Zanke as an fBot (Fire & Forget - DDoS Bot). Matt 
Thayer also found this script which has a description of 
LinuxNet perlbot. The bot answers only based on the 
servername and nickname in the IRC message which is 
configured on the perl script thus you need to be an 
operator on the IRC network to spoof it and in order to 
exploit this bot or have at least the same ip to the config.
