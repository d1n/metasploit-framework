## Zend Server Java Bridge Arbitrary Java Code Execution

This module takes advantage of a trust relationship issue 
within the Zend Server Java Bridge. The Java Bridge is 
responsible for handling interactions between PHP and Java 
code within Zend Server. When Java code is encountered Zend 
Server communicates with the Java Bridge. The Java Bridge 
then handles the java code and creates the objects within 
the Java Virtual Machine. This interaction however, does not 
require any sort of authentication. This leaves the JVM wide 
open to remote attackers. Sending specially crafted data to 
the Java Bridge results in the execution of arbitrary java 
code.
