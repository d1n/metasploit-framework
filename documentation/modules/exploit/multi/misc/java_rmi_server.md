## Java RMI Server Insecure Default Configuration Java Code Execution

This module takes advantage of the default configuration of 
the RMI Registry and RMI Activation services, which allow 
loading classes from any remote (HTTP) URL. As it invokes a 
method in the RMI Distributed Garbage Collector which is 
available via every RMI endpoint, it can be used against 
both rmiregistry and rmid, and against most other (custom) 
RMI endpoints as well. Note that it does not work against 
Java Management Extension (JMX) ports since those do not 
support remote class loading, unless another RMI endpoint is 
active in the same Java process. RMI method calls do not 
support or require any sort of authentication.
