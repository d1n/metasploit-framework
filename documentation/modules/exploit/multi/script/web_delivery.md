## Script Web Delivery

This module quickly fires up a web server that serves a 
payload. The provided command will start the specified 
scripting language interpreter and then download and execute 
the payload. The main purpose of this module is to quickly 
establish a session on a target machine when the attacker 
has to manually type in the command himself, e.g. Command 
Injection, RDP Session, Local Access or maybe Remote Command 
Exec. This attack vector does not write to disk so it is 
less likely to trigger AV solutions and will allow privilege 
escalations supplied by Meterpreter. When using either of 
the PSH targets, ensure the payload architecture matches the 
target computer or use SYSWOW64 powershell.exe to execute 
x86 payloads on x64 machines.
