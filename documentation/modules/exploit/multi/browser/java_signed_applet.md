## Java Signed Applet Social Engineering Code Execution

This exploit dynamically creates a .jar file via the 
Msf::Exploit::Java mixin, then signs the it. The resulting 
signed applet is presented to the victim via a web page with 
an applet tag. The victim's JVM will pop a dialog asking if 
they trust the signed applet. On older versions the dialog 
will display the value of CERTCN in the "Publisher" line. 
Newer JVMs display "UNKNOWN" when the signature is not 
trusted (i.e., it's not signed by a trusted CA). The 
SigningCert option allows you to provide a trusted code 
signing cert, the values in which will override CERTCN. If 
SigningCert is not given, a randomly generated self-signed 
cert will be used. Either way, once the user clicks "run", 
the applet executes with full user permissions.
