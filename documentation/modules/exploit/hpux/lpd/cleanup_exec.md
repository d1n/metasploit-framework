## HP-UX LPD Command Execution

This exploit abuses an unpublished vulnerability in the 
HP-UX LPD service. This flaw allows an unauthenticated 
attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges 
of the root user. The LPD service is only exploitable when 
the address of the attacking system can be resolved by the 
target. This vulnerability was silently patched with the 
buffer overflow flaws addressed in HP Security Bulletin 
HPSBUX0208-213.
