## CakePHP Cache Corruption Code Execution

CakePHP is a popular PHP framework for building web 
applications. The Security component of CakePHP versions 
1.3.5 and earlier and 1.2.8 and earlier is vulnerable to an 
unserialize attack which could be abused to allow 
unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with the 
permissions of the webserver.
