## Foswiki MAKETEXT Remote Command Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability in the MAKETEXT Foswiki 
variable. By using a specially crafted MAKETEXT, a malicious 
user can execute shell commands since the input is passed to 
the Perl "eval" command without first being sanitized. The 
problem is caused by an underlying security issue in the 
CPAN:Locale::Maketext module. Only Foswiki sites that have 
user interface localization enabled 
(UserInterfaceInternationalisation variable set) are 
vulnerable. If USERNAME and PASSWORD aren't provided, 
anonymous access will be tried. Also, if the FoswikiPage 
option isn't provided, the module will try to create a 
random page on the SandBox space. The modules has been 
tested successfully on Foswiki 1.1.5 as distributed with the 
official Foswiki-1.1.5-vmware image.
