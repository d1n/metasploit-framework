## Simple PHP Blog Remote Command Execution

This module combines three separate issues within The Simple 
PHP Blog (<= 0.4.0) application to upload arbitrary data and 
thus execute a shell. The first vulnerability exposes the 
hash file (password.txt) to unauthenticated users. The 
second vulnerability lies within the image upload system 
provided to logged-in users; there is no image validation 
function in the blogger to prevent an authenticated user 
from uploading any file type. The third vulnerability occurs 
within the blog comment functionality, allowing arbitrary 
files to be deleted.
