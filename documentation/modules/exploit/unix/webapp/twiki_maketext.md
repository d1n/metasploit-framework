## TWiki MAKETEXT Remote Command Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability in the MAKETEXT Twiki 
variable. By using a specially crafted MAKETEXT, a malicious 
user can execute shell commands since user input is passed 
to the Perl "eval" command without first being sanitized. 
The problem is caused by an underlying security issue in the 
CPAN:Locale::Maketext module. This works in TWiki sites that 
have user interface localization enabled 
(UserInterfaceInternationalisation variable set). If 
USERNAME and PASSWORD aren't provided, anonymous access will 
be tried. Also, if the 'TwikiPage' option isn't provided, 
the module will try to create a random page on the SandBox 
space. The modules has been tested successfully on TWiki 
5.1.2 as distributed with the official TWiki-VM-5.1.2-1 
virtual machine.
