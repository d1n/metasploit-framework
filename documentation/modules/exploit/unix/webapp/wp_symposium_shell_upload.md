## WordPress WP Symposium 14.11 Shell Upload

WP Symposium Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that 
allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This 
flaw exists because the 
/wp-symposium/server/file_upload_form.php script does not 
properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files. By 
uploading a .php file, the remote system will place the file 
in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the 
uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script 
with the privileges of the web server.
