## SquirrelMail PGP Plugin Command Execution (SMTP)

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in 
the PGP plugin of SquirrelMail. This flaw was found while 
quickly grepping the code after release of some information 
at http://www.wslabi.com/. Later, iDefense published an 
advisory .... Reading an email in SquirrelMail with the PGP 
plugin activated is enough to compromise the underlying 
server. Only "cmd/unix/generic" payloads were tested.
