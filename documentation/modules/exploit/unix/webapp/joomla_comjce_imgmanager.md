## Joomla Component JCE File Upload Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability in the JCE component 
for Joomla!, which could allow an unauthenticated remote 
attacker to upload arbitrary files, caused by the fails to 
sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. Sending 
specially-crafted HTTP request, a remote attacker could 
exploit this vulnerability to upload a malicious PHP script, 
which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code 
on the vulnerable system. This module has been tested 
successfully on the JCE Editor 1.5.71 and Joomla 1.5.26.
