## Setuid Nmap Exploit

Nmap's man page mentions that "Nmap should never be 
installed with special privileges (e.g. suid root) for 
security reasons.." and specifically avoids making any of 
its binaries setuid during installation. Nevertheless, 
administrators sometimes feel the need to do insecure 
things. This module abuses a setuid nmap binary by writing 
out a lua nse script containing a call to os.execute(). Note 
that modern interpreters will refuse to run scripts on the 
command line when EUID != UID, so the 
cmd/unix/reverse_{perl,ruby} payloads will most likely not 
work.
