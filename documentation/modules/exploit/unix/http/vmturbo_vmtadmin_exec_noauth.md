## VMTurbo Operations Manager vmtadmin.cgi Remote Command Execution

VMTurbo Operations Manager 4.6 and prior are vulnerable to 
unauthenticated OS Command injection in the web interface. 
Use reverse payloads for the most reliable results. Since it 
is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no 
output for the executed command when using the cmd generic 
payload. Port binding payloads are disregarded due to the 
restrictive firewall settings. This module has been tested 
successfully on VMTurbo Operations Manager versions 4.5 and 
4.6.
