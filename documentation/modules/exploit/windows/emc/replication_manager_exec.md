## EMC Replication Manager Command Execution

This module exploits a remote command-injection 
vulnerability in EMC Replication Manager client (irccd.exe). 
By sending a specially crafted message invoking RunProgram 
function an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary 
commands with SYSTEM privileges. Affected products are EMC 
Replication Manager < 5.3. This module has been successfully 
tested against EMC Replication Manager 5.2.1 on XP/W2003. 
EMC Networker Module for Microsoft Applications 2.1 and 2.2 
may be vulnerable too although this module have not been 
tested against these products.
