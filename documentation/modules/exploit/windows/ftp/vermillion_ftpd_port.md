## Vermillion FTP Daemon PORT Command Memory Corruption

This module exploits an out-of-bounds array access in the 
Arcane Software Vermillion FTP server. By sending an 
specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt 
stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular 
issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker 
controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. 
Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte 
copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a 
destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the 
input string and continues while the source byte is 
non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments 
the the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is 
encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - 
'0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. 
As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that 
modifications to the current values on the stack result in 
usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the 
return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 
'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen 
since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function 
returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service 
using "vftpd.exe install". If so, the service does not 
restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt.
