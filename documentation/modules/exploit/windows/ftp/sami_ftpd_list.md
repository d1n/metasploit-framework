## Sami FTP Server LIST Command Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow on Sami 
FTP Server 2.0.1. The vulnerability exists in the processing 
of LIST commands. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the 
"Log" tab must be viewed in the Sami FTP Server managing 
application, in the target machine. On the other hand, the 
source IP address used to connect with the FTP Server is 
needed. If the user can't provide it, the module will try to 
resolve it. This module has been tested successfully on Sami 
FTP Server 2.0.1 over Windows XP SP3.
