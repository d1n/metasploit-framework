## ScriptFTP LIST Remote Buffer Overflow

AmmSoft's ScriptFTP client is susceptible to a remote buffer 
overflow vulnerability that is triggered when processing a 
sufficiently long filename during a FTP LIST command 
resulting in overwriting the exception handler. Social 
engineering of executing a specially crafted ftp file by 
double click will result in connecting to our malcious 
server and perform arbitrary code execution which allows the 
attacker to gain the same rights as the user running 
ScriptFTP. This vulnerability affects versions 3.3 and 
earlier.
