## Oracle 9i XDB FTP UNLOCK Overflow (win32)

By passing an overly long token to the UNLOCK command, a 
stack based buffer overflow occurs. David Litchfield, has 
illustrated multiple vulnerabilities in the Oracle 9i XML 
Database (XDB), during a seminar on "Variations in exploit 
methods between Linux and Windows" presented at the Blackhat 
conference. Oracle9i includes a number of default accounts, 
including dbsnmp:dbsmp, scott:tiger, system:manager, and 
sys:change_on_install.
