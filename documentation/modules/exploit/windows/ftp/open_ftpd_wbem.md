## Open-FTPD 1.2 Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found in 
Open&Compact FTP server. The software contains an 
authentication bypass vulnerability and a arbitrary file 
upload vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to write 
arbitrary files to the file system as long as there is at 
least one user who has permission. Code execution can be 
achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote 
machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, 
which enables WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to 
execute the uploaded payload. Please note that this module 
currently only works for Windows before Vista.
