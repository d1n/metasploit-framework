## Ability Server 2.34 STOR Command Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in 
Ability Server 2.34. Ability Server fails to check input 
size when parsing 'STOR' and 'APPE' commands, which leads to 
a stack based buffer overflow. This plugin uses the 'STOR' 
command. The vulnerability has been confirmed on version 
2.34 and has also been reported in version 2.25 and 2.32. 
Other versions may also be affected.
