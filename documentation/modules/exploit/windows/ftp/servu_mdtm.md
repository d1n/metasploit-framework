## Serv-U FTPD MDTM Overflow

This is an exploit for the Serv-U\'s MDTM command timezone 
overflow. It has been heavily tested against versions 
4.0.0.4/4.1.0.0/4.1.0.3/5.0.0.0 with success against 
nt4/2k/xp/2k3. I have also had success against version 3, 
but only tested 1 version/os. The bug is in all versions 
prior to 5.0.0.4, but this exploit will not work against 
versions not listed above. You only get one shot, but it 
should be OS/SP independent. This exploit is a single hit, 
the service dies after the shellcode finishes execution.
