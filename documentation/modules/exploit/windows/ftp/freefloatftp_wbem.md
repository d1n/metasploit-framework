## FreeFloat FTP Server Arbitrary File Upload

This module abuses multiple issues in FreeFloat: 1. No 
credential is actually needed to login; 2. User's default 
path is in C:\, and this cannot be changed; 3. User can 
write to anywhere on the server's file system. As a result 
of these poor implementations, a malicious user can just log 
in and then upload files, and let WMI (Management 
Instrumentation service) to execute the payload uploaded.
