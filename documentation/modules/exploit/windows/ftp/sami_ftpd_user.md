## KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server v2.02 USER Overflow

This module exploits the KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server version 
2.02 by sending an excessively long USER string. The stack 
is overwritten when the administrator attempts to view the 
FTP logs. Therefore, this exploit is passive and requires 
end-user interaction. Keep this in mind when selecting 
payloads. When the server is restarted, it will re-execute 
the exploit until the logfile is manually deleted via the 
file system.
