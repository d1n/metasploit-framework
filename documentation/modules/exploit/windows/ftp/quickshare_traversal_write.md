## QuickShare File Server 1.2.1 Directory Traversal Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability found in QuickShare 
File Server's FTP service. By supplying "../" in the file 
path, it is possible to trigger a directory traversal flaw, 
allowing the attacker to read a file outside the virtual 
directory. By default, the "Writable" option is enabled 
during account creation, therefore this makes it possible to 
create a file at an arbitrary location, which leads to 
remote code execution.
