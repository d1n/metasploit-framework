## FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 Transfer-Mode Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the 
FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 product. By sending an overly 
long transfer-mode string, we were able to overwrite both 
the SEH and the saved EIP. A subsequent write-exception that 
will occur allows the transferring of execution to our 
shellcode via the overwritten SEH. This module has been 
tested against Windows 2000 Professional and for some reason 
does not seem to work against Windows 2000 Server (could not 
trigger the overflow at all).
