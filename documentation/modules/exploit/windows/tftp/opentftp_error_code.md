## OpenTFTP SP 1.4 Error Packet Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in OpenTFTP Server SP 
1.4. The vulnerable condition triggers when the TFTP opcode 
is configured as an error packet, the TFTP service will then 
format the message using a sprintf() function, which causes 
an overflow, therefore allowing remote code execution under 
the context of SYSTEM. The offset (to EIP) is specific to 
how the TFTP was started (as a 'Stand Alone', or 'Service'). 
By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the 
default configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's 
installation.
