## Computer Associates License Client GETCONFIG Overflow

This module exploits an vulnerability in the CA License 
Client service. This exploit will only work if your IP 
address can be resolved from the target system point of 
view. This can be accomplished on a local network by running 
the 'nmbd' service that comes with Samba. If you are running 
this exploit from Windows and do not filter udp port 137, 
this should not be a problem (if the target is on the same 
network segment). Due to the bugginess of the software, you 
are only allowed one connection to the agent port before it 
starts ignoring you. If it wasn't for this issue, it would 
be possible to repeatedly exploit this bug.
