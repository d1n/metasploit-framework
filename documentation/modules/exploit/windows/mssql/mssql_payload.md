## Microsoft SQL Server Payload Execution

This module executes an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL 
Server by using the "xp_cmdshell" stored procedure. 
Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the 
original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size 
restrictions are avoidied by incorporating the debug bypass 
method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this 
method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x86_64 systems. 
A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager 
subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as 
using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the 
Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable 
on the target. Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes 
PowerShell to transmit and recreate the payload on the 
target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on 
the target system when the attack is finished.
