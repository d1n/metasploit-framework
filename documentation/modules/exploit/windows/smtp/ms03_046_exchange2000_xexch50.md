## MS03-046 Exchange 2000 XEXCH50 Heap Overflow

This is an exploit for the Exchange 2000 heap overflow. Due 
to the nature of the vulnerability, this exploit is not very 
reliable. This module has been tested against Exchange 2000 
SP0 and SP3 running a Windows 2000 system patched to SP4. It 
normally takes between one and 100 connection attempts to 
successfully obtain a shell. This exploit is *very* 
unreliable.
