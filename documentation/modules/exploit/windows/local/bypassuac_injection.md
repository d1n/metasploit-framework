## Windows Escalate UAC Protection Bypass (In Memory Injection)

This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the trusted 
publisher certificate through process injection. It will 
spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This 
module uses the Reflective DLL Injection technique to drop 
only the DLL payload binary instead of three seperate 
binaries in the standard technique. However, it requires the 
correct architecture to be selected, (use x64 for SYSWOW64 
systems also). If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should 
call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a seperate 
process.
