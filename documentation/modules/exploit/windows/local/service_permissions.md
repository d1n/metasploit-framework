## Windows Escalate Service Permissions Local Privilege Escalation

This module attempts to exploit existing administrative 
privileges to obtain a SYSTEM session. If directly creating 
a service fails, this module will inspect existing services 
to look for insecure file or configuration permissions that 
may be hijacked. It will then attempt to restart the 
replaced service to run the payload. This will result in a 
new session when this succeeds.
