## Nvidia (nvsvc) Display Driver Service Local Privilege Escalation

The named pipe, \pipe\nsvr, has a NULL DACL allowing any 
authenticated user to interact with the service. It contains 
a stacked based buffer overflow as a result of a memmove 
operation. Note the slight spelling differences: the 
executable is 'nvvsvc.exe', the service name is 'nvsvc', and 
the named pipe is 'nsvr'. This exploit automatically targets 
nvvsvc.exe versions dated Nov 3 2011, Aug 30 2012, and Dec 1 
2012. It has been tested on Windows 7 64-bit against 
nvvsvc.exe dated Dec 1 2012.
