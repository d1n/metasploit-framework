## Persistent Payload in Windows Volume Shadow Copy

This module will attempt to create a persistent payload in a 
new volume shadow copy. This is based on the VSSOwn Script 
originally posted by Tim Tomes and Mark Baggett. This module 
has been tested successfully on Windows 7. In order to 
achieve persistence through the RUNKEY option, the user 
should need password in order to start session on the target 
machine.
