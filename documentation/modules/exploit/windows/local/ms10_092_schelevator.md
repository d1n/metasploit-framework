## Windows Escalate Task Scheduler XML Privilege Escalation

This module exploits the Task Scheduler 2.0 XML 0day 
exploited by Stuxnet. When processing task files, the 
Windows Task Scheduler only uses a CRC32 checksum to 
validate that the file has not been tampered with. Also, In 
a default configuration, normal users can read and write the 
task files that they have created. By modifying the task 
file and creating a CRC32 collision, an attacker can execute 
arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. NOTE: Thanks to 
webDEViL for the information about disable/enable.
