## IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keyring Modules Service (IKEEXT) Missing DLL

This module exploits a missing DLL loaded by the 'IKE and 
AuthIP Keyring Modules' (IKEEXT) service which runs as 
SYSTEM, and starts automatically in default installations of 
Vista-Win8. It requires an insecure bin path to plant the 
DLL payload.
