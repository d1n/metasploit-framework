## Novell Client 4.91 SP4 nwfs.sys Local Privilege Escalation

This module exploits a flaw in the nwfs.sys driver to 
overwrite data in kernel space. The corruption occurs while 
handling ioctl requests with code 0x1438BB, where a 
0x00000009 dword is written to an arbitrary address. An 
entry within the HalDispatchTable is overwritten in order to 
execute arbitrary code when NtQueryIntervalProfile is 
called. The module has been tested successfully on Windows 
XP SP3 with Novell Client 4.91 SP4.
