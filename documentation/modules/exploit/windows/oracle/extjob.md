## Oracle Job Scheduler Named Pipe Command Execution

This module exploits the Oracle Job Scheduler to execute 
arbitrary commands. The Job Scheduler is implemented via the 
component extjob.exe which listens on a named pipe called 
"orcljsex<SID>" and execute arbitrary commands received over 
this channel via CreateProcess(). In order to connect to the 
Named Pipe remotely, SMB access is required. Note that the 
Job Scheduler is disabled in default installations.
