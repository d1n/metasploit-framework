## MPlayer Lite M3U Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow 
vulnerability in MPlayer Lite r33064, caused by improper 
bounds checking of an URL entry. By persuading the victim to 
open a specially-crafted .M3U file, specifically by 
drag-and-dropping it to the player, a remote attacker can 
execute arbitrary code on the system.
