## DVD X Player 5.5 .plf PlayList Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow on DVD X 
Player 5.5 Pro and Standard. By supplying a long string of 
data in a plf file (playlist), the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll 
component will attempt to extract a filename out of the 
string, and then copy it on the stack without any proper 
bounds checking, which casues a buffer overflow, and results 
arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. This 
module has been designed to target common Windows systems 
such as: Windows XP SP2/SP3, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.
