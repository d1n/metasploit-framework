## McAfee SaaS MyCioScan ShowReport Remote Command Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability found in McAfee 
Security-as-a-Service. The ShowReport() function (located in 
the myCIOScn.dll ActiveX component) fails to check the 
FileName argument, and passes it on to a ShellExecuteW() 
function, therefore allows any malicious attacker to execute 
any process that's on the local system. However, if the 
victim machine is connected to a remote share ( or something 
similiar), then it's also possible to execute arbitrary 
code. Please note that a custom template is required for the 
payload, because the default Metasploit template is 
detectable by McAfee -- any Windows binary, such as calc.exe 
or notepad.exe, should bypass McAfee fine.
