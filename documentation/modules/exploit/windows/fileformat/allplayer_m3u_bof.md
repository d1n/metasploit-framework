## ALLPlayer M3U Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow 
vulnerability in ALLPlayer 2.8.1, caused by a long string in 
a playlist entry. By persuading the victim to open a 
specially-crafted .M3U file, a remote attacker could execute 
arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to 
crash. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 
SP1.
