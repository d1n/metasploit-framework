## Apple Quicktime 7 Invalid Atom Length Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple 
Quicktime. The flaw is triggered when Quicktime fails to 
properly handle the data length for certain atoms such as 
'rdrf' or 'dref' in the Alis record, which may result a 
buffer overflow by loading a specially crafted .mov file, 
and allows arbitrary code execution under the context of the 
current user. Please note: Since an egghunter is used to 
search for the payload, this may require additional time for 
the exploit to complete.
