## Easy CD-DA Recorder PLS Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow 
vulnerability in Easy CD-DA Recorder 2007 caused by an 
overlong string in a playlist entry. By persuading the 
victim to open a specially-crafted PLS file, a remote 
attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system or cause 
the application to crash. This module has been tested 
successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.
