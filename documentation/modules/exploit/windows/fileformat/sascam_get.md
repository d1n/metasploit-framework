## SasCam Webcam Server v.2.6.5 Get() Method Buffer Overflow

The SasCam Webcam Server ActiveX control is vulnerable to a 
buffer overflow. By passing an overly long argument via the 
Get method, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and 
execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of 
the user. This control is not marked safe for scripting, 
please choose your attack vector carefully.
