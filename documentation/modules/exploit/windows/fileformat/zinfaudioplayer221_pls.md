## Zinf Audio Player 2.2.1 (PLS File) Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the 
Zinf Audio Player 2.2.1. An attacker must send the file to 
victim and the victim must open the file. Alternatively it 
may be possible to execute code remotely via an embedded PLS 
file within a browser, when the PLS extention is registered 
to Zinf. This functionality has not been tested in this 
module.
