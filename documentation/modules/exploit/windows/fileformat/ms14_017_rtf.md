## MS14-017 Microsoft Word RTF Object Confusion

This module creates a malicious RTF file that when opened in 
vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code 
execution. The flaw exists in how a listoverridecount field 
can be modified to treat one structure as another. This bug 
was originally seen being exploited in the wild starting in 
April 2014. This module was created by reversing a public 
malware sample.
