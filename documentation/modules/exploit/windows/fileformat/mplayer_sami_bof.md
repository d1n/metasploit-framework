## MPlayer SAMI Subtitle File Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow found in 
the handling of SAMI subtitles files in MPlayer SVN Versions 
before 33471. It currently targets SMPlayer 0.6.8, which is 
distributed with a vulnerable version of mplayer. The 
overflow is triggered when an unsuspecting victim opens a 
movie file first, followed by loading the malicious SAMI 
subtitles file from the GUI. Or, it can also be done from 
the console with the mplayer "-sub" option.
