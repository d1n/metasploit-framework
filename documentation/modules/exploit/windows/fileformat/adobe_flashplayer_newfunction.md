## Adobe Flash Player "newfunction" Invalid Pointer Use

This module exploits a vulnerability in the DoABC tag 
handling within versions 9.x and 10.0 of Adobe Flash Player. 
Adobe Reader and Acrobat are also vulnerable, as are any 
other applications that may embed Flash player. Arbitrary 
code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted 
Flash movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is 
used in order to ensure that the memory used by the invalid 
pointer issue is controlled. NOTE: This module uses a 
similar DEP bypass method to that used within the 
adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across 
various Windows versions due a the hardcoded syscall number.
