## UltraISO CCD File Parsing Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in EZB 
Systems, Inc's UltraISO. When processing .CCD files, data is 
read from file into a fixed-size stack buffer. Since no 
bounds checking is done, a buffer overflow can occur. 
Attackers can execute arbitrary code by convincing their 
victim to open an CCD file. NOTE: A file with the same base 
name, but the extension of "img" must also exist. Opening 
either file will trigger the vulnerability, but the files 
must both exist.
