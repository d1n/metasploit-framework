## Audiotran PLS File Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in 
Audiotran 1.4.2.4. An attacker must send the file to victim 
and the victim must open the file. Alternatively, it may be 
possible to execute code remotely via an embedded PLS file 
within a browser when the PLS extention is registered to 
Audiotran. This alternate vector has not been tested and 
cannot be exercised directly with this module.
