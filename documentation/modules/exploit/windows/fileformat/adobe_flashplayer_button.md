## Adobe Flash Player "Button" Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of 
certain SWF movies within versions 9.x and 10.0 of Adobe 
Flash Player. Adobe Reader and Acrobat are also vulnerable, 
as are any other applications that may embed Flash player. 
Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a 
specially crafted Flash movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS 
heap spray is used in order to ensure that the memory used 
by the invalid pointer issue is controlled. NOTE: This 
module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within 
the adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work 
across various Windows versions due a the hardcoded syscall 
number.
