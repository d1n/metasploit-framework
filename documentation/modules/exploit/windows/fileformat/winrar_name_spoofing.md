## WinRAR Filename Spoofing

This module abuses a filename spoofing vulnerability in 
WinRAR. The vulnerability exists when opening ZIP files. The 
file names showed in WinRAR when opening a ZIP file come 
from the central directory, but the file names used to 
extract and open contents come from the Local File Header. 
This inconsistency allows to spoof file names when opening 
ZIP files with WinRAR, which can be abused to execute 
arbitrary code, as exploited in the wild in March 2014
