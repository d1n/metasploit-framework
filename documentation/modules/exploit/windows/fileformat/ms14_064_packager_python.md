## MS14-064 Microsoft Windows OLE Package Manager Code Execution Through Python

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object 
Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code 
execution, bypassing the patch MS14-060, for the 
vulnerability publicly known as "Sandworm", on systems with 
Python for Windows installed. Windows Vista SP2 all the way 
to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be 
vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable 
setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 
2010 SP2. Please keep in mind that some other setups such as 
those using Office 2010 SP1 may be less stable, and may end 
up with a crash due to a failure in the 
CPackage::CreateTempFileName function.
