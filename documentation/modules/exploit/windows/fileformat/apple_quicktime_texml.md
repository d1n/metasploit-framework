## Apple QuickTime TeXML Style Element Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple 
QuickTime. When handling a TeXML file, it is possible to 
trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, and then gain 
arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. This 
is due to the QuickTime3GPP.gtx component not handling 
certain Style subfields properly, storing user-supplied data 
on the stack, which results the overflow.
