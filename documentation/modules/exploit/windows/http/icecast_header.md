## Icecast Header Overwrite

This module exploits a buffer overflow in the header parsing 
of icecast versions 2.0.1 and earlier, discovered by Luigi 
Auriemma. Sending 32 HTTP headers will cause a write one 
past the end of a pointer array. On win32 this happens to 
overwrite the saved instruction pointer, and on linux 
(depending on compiler, etc) this seems to generally 
overwrite nothing crucial (read not exploitable). This 
exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking 
the thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be 
decremented. This means for each time your payload exits, 
the counter will be left incremented, and eventually the 
threadpool limit will be maxed. So you can multihit, but 
only till you fill the threadpool.
