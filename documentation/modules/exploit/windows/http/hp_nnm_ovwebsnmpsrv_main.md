## HP OpenView Network Node Manager ovwebsnmpsrv.exe main Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView 
Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By specifying 
a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI 
program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow 
and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is 
triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The buffer 
being written to is 1024 bytes in size. It is important to 
note that this vulnerability must be exploited by 
overwriting SEH. Otherwise, CVE-2010-1961 is triggered! The 
vulnerable code is within the "main" function within 
"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 
2010. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily 
achieved by overwriting SEH structures. There exists some 
unreliability when running this exploit. It is not 
completely clear why at this time, but may be related to 
OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts OV NNM 
may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear 
what is causing this either.
