## HP Intelligent Management Center Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP Intelligent 
Management Center. The vulnerability exists in the 
mibFileUpload which is accepting unauthenticated file 
uploads and handling zip contents in a insecure way. 
Combining both weaknesses a remote attacker can accomplish 
arbitrary file upload. This module has been tested 
successfully on HP Intelligent Management Center 5.1 E0202 
over Windows 2003 SP2.
