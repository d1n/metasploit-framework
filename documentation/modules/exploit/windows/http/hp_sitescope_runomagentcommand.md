## HP SiteScope Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP SiteScope. 
The vulnerability exists in the opcactivate.vbs script, 
which is reachable from the APIBSMIntegrationImpl AXIS 
service, and uses WScript.Shell.run() to execute cmd.exe 
with user provided data. Note that the opcactivate.vbs 
component is installed with the (optional) HP Operations 
Agent component. The module has been tested successfully on 
HP SiteScope 11.20 (with HP Operations Agent) over Windows 
2003 SP2.
