## HP OpenView Network Node Manager execvp_nc Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView 
Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01207 or NNM_01206 
without the SSRT100025 hotfix. By specifying a long 'sel' 
parameter when calling methods within the 'webappmon.exe' 
CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer 
overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is 
not triggerable via a GET request due to limitations on the 
request size. The buffer being targetted is 16384 bytes in 
size. There are actually two adjacent buffers that both get 
overflowed (one into the other), and strcat is used. The 
vulnerable code is within the "execvp_nc" function within 
"ov.dll" prior to v 1.30.12.69. There are no stack cookies, 
so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved 
return address or SEH frame. This vulnerability might also 
be triggerable via other CGI programs, however this was not 
fully investigated.
