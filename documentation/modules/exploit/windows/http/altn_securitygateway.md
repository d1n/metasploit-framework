## Alt-N SecurityGateway username Buffer Overflow

Alt-N SecurityGateway is prone to a buffer overflow 
condition. This is due to insufficient bounds checking on 
the "username" parameter. Successful exploitation could 
result in code execution with SYSTEM level privileges. NOTE: 
This service doesn't restart, you'll only get one shot. 
However, it often survives a successful exploitation 
attempt.
