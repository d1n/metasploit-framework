## HP ProCurve Manager SNAC UpdateCertificatesServlet File Upload

This module exploits a path traversal flaw in the HP 
ProCurve Manager SNAC Server. The vulnerability in the 
UpdateCertificatesServlet allows an attacker to upload 
arbitrary files, just having into account binary writes 
aren't allowed. Additionally, authentication can be bypassed 
in order to upload the file. This module has been tested 
successfully on the SNAC server installed with HP ProCurve 
Manager 4.0.
