## LANDesk Lenovo ThinkManagement Console Remote Command Execution

This module can be used to execute a payload on LANDesk 
Lenovo ThinkManagement Suite 9.0.2 and 9.0.3. The payload is 
uploaded as an ASP script by sending a specially crafted 
SOAP request to 
"/landesk/managementsuite/core/core.anonymous/ServerSetup.asmx" 
, via a "RunAMTCommand" operation with the command 
'-PutUpdateFileCore' as the argument. After execution, the 
ASP script with the payload is deleted by sending another 
specially crafted SOAP request to 
"WSVulnerabilityCore/VulCore.asmx" via a "SetTaskLogByFile" 
operation.
