## Numara / BMC Track-It! FileStorageService Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability 
in Numara / BMC Track-It! v8 to v11.X. The application 
exposes the FileStorageService .NET remoting service on port 
9010 (9004 for version 8) which accepts unauthenticated 
uploads. This can be abused by a malicious user to upload a 
ASP or ASPX file to the web root leading to arbitrary code 
execution as NETWORK SERVICE or SYSTEM. This module has been 
tested successfully on versions 11.3.0.355, 10.0.51.135, 
10.0.50.107, 10.0.0.143, 9.0.30.248 and 8.0.2.51.
