## HP SiteScope DNS Tool Command Injection

This module exploits a command injection vulnerability 
discovered in HP SiteScope 11.30 and earlier versions 
(tested in 11.26 and 11.30). The vulnerability exists in the 
DNS Tool allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands 
in the context of the service. By default, HP SiteScope 
installs and runs as SYSTEM in Windows and does not require 
authentication. This vulnerability only exists on the 
Windows version. The Linux version is unaffected.
