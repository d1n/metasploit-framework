## MiniWeb (Build 300) Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a vulnerability in MiniWeb HTTP server 
(build 300). The software contains a file upload 
vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker 
to write arbitrary files to the file system. Code execution 
can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote 
machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, 
which enables WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to 
execute the uploaded payload. Please note that this module 
currently only works for Windows before Vista.
