## HP OpenView NNM 7.53, 7.51 OVAS.EXE Pre-Authentication Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView 
Network Node Manager versions 7.53 and earlier. Specifically 
this vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle 
user supplied input within the HTTP request including 
headers and the actual URL GET request. Exploitation is 
tricky due to character restrictions. It was necessary to 
utilize a egghunter shellcode which was alphanumeric encoded 
by muts in the original exploit. If you plan on using 
exploit this for a remote shell, you will likely want to 
migrate to a different process as soon as possible. Any 
connections get reset after a short period of time. This is 
probably some timeout handling code that causes this.
