## Umbraco CMS Remote Command Execution

This module can be used to execute a payload on Umbraco CMS 
4.7.0.378. The payload is uploaded as an ASPX script by 
sending a specially crafted SOAP request to 
codeEditorSave.asmx, which permits unauthorised file upload 
via the SaveDLRScript operation. SaveDLRScript is also 
subject to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing code to 
be placed into the web-accessible /umbraco/ directory. The 
module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; 
note that though the script content is removed, the file 
remains on the target. Automatic cleanup of the file is 
intended if a meterpreter payload is used. This module has 
been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a 
Windows 7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the "IIS 
APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0" user must have write permissions on 
the Windows Temp folder.
