## Novell Messenger Server 2.0 Accept-Language Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Novell 
GroupWise Messenger Server v2.0. This flaw is triggered by 
any HTTP request with an Accept-Language header greater than 
16 bytes. To overwrite the return address on the stack, we 
must first pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we 
supply. Due to the large list of restricted characters and 
the limitations of the current encoder modules, very few 
payloads are usable.
