## Oracle Event Processing FileUploadServlet Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability 
in Oracle Event Processing 11.1.1.7.0. The FileUploadServlet 
component, which requires no authentication, can be abused 
to upload a malicious file onto an arbitrary location due to 
a directory traversal flaw, and compromise the server. By 
default Oracle Event Processing uses a Jetty Application 
Server without JSP support, which limits the attack to 
WbemExec. The current WbemExec technique only requires 
arbitrary write to the file system, but at the moment the 
module only supports Windows 2003 SP2 or older.
