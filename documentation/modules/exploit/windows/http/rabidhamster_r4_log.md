## RabidHamster R4 Log Entry sprintf() Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in RabidHamster 
R4's web server. By supplying a malformed HTTP request, it 
is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow when 
generating a log, which may result in arbitrary code 
execution under the context of the user.
