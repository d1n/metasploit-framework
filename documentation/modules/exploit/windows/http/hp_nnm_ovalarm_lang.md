## HP OpenView Network Node Manager ovalarm.exe CGI Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView 
Network Node Manager 7.53. By sending a specially crafted 
CGI request to ovalarm.exe, an attacker can execute 
arbitrary code. This specific vulnerability is due to a call 
to "sprintf_new" in the "isWide" function within 
"ovalarm.exe". A stack buffer overflow occurs when 
processing an HTTP request that contains the following. 1. 
An "Accept-Language" header longer than 100 bytes 2. An 
"OVABverbose" URI variable set to "on", "true" or "1" The 
vulnerability is related to "_WebSession::GetWebLocale()" .. 
NOTE: This exploit has been tested successfully with a 
reverse_ord_tcp payload.
