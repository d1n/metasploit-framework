## Apache Module mod_rewrite LDAP Protocol Buffer Overflow

This module exploits the mod_rewrite LDAP protocol scheme 
handling flaw discovered by Mark Dowd, which produces an 
off-by-one overflow. Apache versions 1.3.29-36, 2.0.47-58, 
and 2.2.1-2 are vulnerable. This module requires REWRITEPATH 
to be set accurately. In addition, the target must have 
'RewriteEngine on' configured, with a specific 'RewriteRule' 
condition enabled to allow for exploitation. The flaw 
affects multiple platforms, however this module currently 
only supports Windows based installations.
