## Mercur v5.0 IMAP SP3 SELECT Buffer Overflow

Mercur v5.0 IMAP server is prone to a remotely exploitable 
stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due 
to a failure of the application to properly bounds check 
user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed size 
memory buffer. Credit to Tim Taylor for discover the 
vulnerability.
