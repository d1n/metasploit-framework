## 7-Technologies IGSS 9 IGSSdataServer .RMS Rename Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found on 7-Technologies 
IGSS 9. By supplying a long string of data to the 'Rename' 
(0x02), 'Delete' (0x03), or 'Add' (0x04) command, a buffer 
overflow condition occurs in IGSSdataServer.exe while 
handing an RMS report, which results arbitrary code 
execution under the context of the user. The attack is 
carried out in three stages. The first stage sends the final 
payload to IGSSdataServer.exe, which will remain in memory. 
The second stage sends the Add command so the process can 
find a valid ID for the Rename command. The last stage then 
triggers the vulnerability with the Rename command, and uses 
an egghunter to search for the shellcode that we sent in 
stage 1. The use of egghunter appears to be necessary due to 
the small buffer size, which cannot even contain our ROP 
chain and the final payload.
