## AwingSoft Winds3D Player 3.5 SceneURL Download and Execute

This module exploits an untrusted program execution 
vulnerability within the Winds3D Player from AwingSoft. The 
Winds3D Player is a browser plugin for IE (ActiveX), Opera 
(DLL) and Firefox (XPI). By setting the 'SceneURL' parameter 
to the URL to an executable, an attacker can execute 
arbitrary code. Testing was conducted using plugin version 
3.5.0.9 for Firefox 3.5 and IE 8 on Windows XP SP3.
