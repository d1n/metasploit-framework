## IBM Lotus QuickR qp2 ActiveX Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability on the 
UploadControl ActiveX. The vulnerability exists in the 
handling of the "Attachment_Times" property, due to the 
insecure usage of the _swscanf. The affected ActiveX is 
provided by the qp2.dll installed with the IBM Lotus Quickr 
product. This module has been tested successfully on IE6-IE9 
on Windows XP, Vista and 7, using the qp2.dll 8.1.0.1800. In 
order to bypass ASLR the no aslr compatible module 
msvcr71.dll is used. This one is installed with the qp2 
ActiveX.
