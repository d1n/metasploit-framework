## MS08-078 Microsoft Internet Explorer Data Binding Memory Corruption

This module exploits a vulnerability in the data binding 
feature of Internet Explorer. In order to execute code 
reliably, this module uses the .NET DLL memory technique 
pioneered by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd. This method is 
used to create a fake vtable at a known location with all 
methods pointing to our payload. Since the .text segment of 
the .NET DLL is non-writable, a prefixed code stub is used 
to copy the payload into a new memory segment and continue 
execution from there.
