## Adobe Flash Player UncompressViaZlibVariant Uninitialized Memory

This module exploits an unintialized memory vulnerability in 
Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability occurs in the 
ByteArray::UncompressViaZlibVariant method, which fails to 
initialize allocated memory. When using a correct memory 
layout this vulnerability leads to a ByteArray object 
corruption, which can be abused to access and corrupt 
memory. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 
7 SP1 (32-bit), IE 8 and IE11 with Flash 15.0.0.189.
