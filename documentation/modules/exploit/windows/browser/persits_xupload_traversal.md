## Persits XUpload ActiveX MakeHttpRequest Directory Traversal

This module exploits a directory traversal in Persits 
Software Inc's XUpload ActiveX control(version 3.0.0.3) 
that's included in HP LoadRunner 9.5. By passing a string 
containing "..\" sequences to the MakeHttpRequest method, an 
attacker is able to write arbitrary files to arbitrary 
locations on disk. Code execution occurs by writing to the 
All Users Startup Programs directory. You may want to 
combine this module with the use of exploit/multi/handler 
since a user would have to log for the payload to execute.
