## MS06-013 Microsoft Internet Explorer createTextRange() Code Execution

This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in 
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both IE6 and IE7 (Beta 2) are 
vulnerable. It will corrupt memory in a way, which, under 
certain circumstances, can lead to an invalid/corrupt table 
pointer dereference. EIP will point to a very remote, 
non-existent memory location. This module is the result of 
merging three different exploit submissions and has only 
been reliably tested against Windows XP SP2. This 
vulnerability was independently discovered by multiple 
parties. The heap spray method used by this exploit was 
pioneered by Skylined.
