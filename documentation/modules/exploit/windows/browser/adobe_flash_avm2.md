## Adobe Flash Player Integer Underflow Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability found in the ActiveX 
component of Adobe Flash Player before 12.0.0.43. By 
supplying a specially crafted swf file it is possible to 
trigger an integer underflow in several avm2 instructions, 
which can be turned into remote code execution under the 
context of the user, as exploited in the wild in February 
2014. This module has been tested successfully with Adobe 
Flash Player 11.7.700.202 on Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 SP1 
and Adobe Flash Player 11.3.372.94 on Windows 8 even when it 
includes rop chains for several Flash 11 versions, as 
exploited in the wild.
