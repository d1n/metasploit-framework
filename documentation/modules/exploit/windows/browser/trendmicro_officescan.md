## Trend Micro OfficeScan Client ActiveX Control Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Trend Micro 
OfficeScan Corporate Edition 7.3. By sending an overly long 
string to the "CgiOnUpdate()" method located in the 
OfficeScanSetupINI.dll Control, an attacker may be able to 
execute arbitrary code.
