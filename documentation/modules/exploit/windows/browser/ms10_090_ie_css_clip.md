## MS10-090 Microsoft Internet Explorer CSS SetUserClip Memory Corruption

Thie module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability 
within Microsoft's HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an 
HTML page containing a specially crafted CSS tag, memory 
corruption occurs that can lead arbitrary code execution. It 
seems like Microsoft code inadvertantly increments a vtable 
pointer to point to an unaligned address within the vtable's 
function pointers. This leads to the program counter being 
set to the address determined by the address 
"[vtable+0x30+1]". The particular address depends on the 
exact version of the mshtml library in use. Since the 
address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may 
not be exploitable. Specifically, those ending up with a 
program counter value within another module, in kernel 
space, or just not able to be reached with various memory 
spraying techniques. Also, since the address is not 
controllable, it is unlikely to be possible to use ROP to 
bypass non-executable memory protections.
