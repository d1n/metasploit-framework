## WebEx UCF atucfobj.dll ActiveX NewObject Method Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in 
WebEx's WebexUCFObject ActiveX Control. If an long string is 
passed to the 'NewObject' method, a stack- based buffer 
overflow will occur when copying attacker-supplied data 
using the sprintf function. It is noteworthy that this 
vulnerability was discovered and reported by multiple 
independent researchers. To quote iDefense's advisory, 
"Before this issue was publicly reported, at least three 
independent security researchers had knowledge of this 
issue; thus, it is reasonable to believe that even more 
people were aware of this issue before disclosure." NOTE: 
Due to input restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to 
get the payload into memory unmodified.
