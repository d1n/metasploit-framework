## Tom Sawyer Software GET Extension Factory Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability 
in the tsgetx71ex553.dll ActiveX control installed with Tom 
Sawyer GET Extension Factory due to an incorrect 
initialization under Internet Explorer. While the Tom Sawyer 
GET Extension Factory is installed with some versions of 
VMware Infrastructure Client, this module has been tested 
only with the versions installed with Embarcadero 
Technologies ER/Studio XE2 / Embarcadero Studio Portal 1.6. 
The ActiveX control tested is tsgetx71ex553.dll, version 
5.5.3.238. This module achieves DEP and ASLR bypass using 
the well known msvcr71.dll rop chain. The dll is installed 
by default with the Embarcadero software, and loaded by the 
targeted ActiveX.
