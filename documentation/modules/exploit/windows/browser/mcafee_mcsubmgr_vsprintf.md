## McAfee Subscription Manager Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a flaw in the McAfee Subscription 
Manager ActiveX control. Due to an unsafe use of vsprintf, 
it is possible to trigger a stack buffer overflow by passing 
a large string to one of the COM-exposed routines, such as 
IsAppExpired. This vulnerability was discovered by Karl Lynn 
of eEye.
