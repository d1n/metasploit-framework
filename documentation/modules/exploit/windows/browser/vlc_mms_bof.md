## VLC MMS Stream Handling Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in VLC media player 
VLC media player prior to 2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to 
a dangerous use of sprintf which can result in a stack 
buffer overflow when handling a malicious MMS URI. This 
module uses the browser as attack vector. A specially 
crafted MMS URI is used to trigger the overflow and get flow 
control through SEH overwrite. Control is transferred to 
code located in the heap through a standard heap spray. The 
module only targets IE6 and IE7 because no DEP/ASLR bypass 
has been provided.
