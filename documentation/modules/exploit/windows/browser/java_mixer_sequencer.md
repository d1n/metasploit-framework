## Java MixerSequencer Object GM_Song Structure Handling Vulnerability

This module exploits a flaw within the handling of 
MixerSequencer objects in Java 6u18 and before. Exploitation 
id done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file within an 
RMF File. When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play 
the file, the GM_Song structure is populated with a function 
pointer provided by a SONG block in the RMF. A Midi block 
that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller 
event is used to trigger the vulnerability. When triggering 
the vulnerability "ebx" points to a fake event in the MIDI 
file which stores the shellcode. A "jmp ebx" from 
msvcr71.dll is used to make the exploit reliable over java 
updates.
