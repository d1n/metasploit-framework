## MS13-080 Microsoft Internet Explorer SetMouseCapture Use-After-Free

This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability that 
currents targets Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7, but the 
flaw should exist in versions 6/7/8/9/10/11. It was 
initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such 
as English, Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well. The 
vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture 
function handles a reference during an event. An attacker 
first can setup two elements, where the second is the child 
of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler 
for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to 
require two setCapture() calls to trigger, one for the 
parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() 
call for the child element is called, it finally triggers 
the event, which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary 
memory release using document.write(), which in particular 
frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory 
may differ based on the version of IE. After the free, an 
invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more 
functions, eventuall this arrives in function 
MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or 
arbitrary code execution) when this function attempts to use 
this reference to call what appears to be a 
PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00). To mimic the 
same exploit found in the wild, this module will try to use 
the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage 
the attack.
