## Java CMM Remote Code Execution

This module abuses the Color Management classes from a Java 
Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as 
exploited in the wild in February and March of 2013. The 
vulnerability affects Java version 7u15 and earlier and 6u41 
and earlier and has been tested successfully on Windows XP 
SP3 and Windows 7 SP1 systems. This exploit doesn't bypass 
click-to-play, so the user must accept the java warning in 
order to run the malicious applet.
