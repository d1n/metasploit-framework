## Adobe Flash Player AVM Bytecode Verification Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player 
versions 10.2.152.33 and earlier. This issue is caused by a 
failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic. This 
results in unsafe JIT(Just-In-Time) code being executed. 
This is the same vulnerability that was used for the RSA 
attack in March 2011. Specifically, this issue results in 
uninitialized memory being referenced and later executed. 
Taking advantage of this issue relies on heap spraying and 
controlling the uninitialized memory. Currently this exploit 
works for IE6, IE7, and Firefox 3.6 and likely several other 
browsers. DEP does catch the exploit and causes it to fail. 
Due to the nature of the uninitialized memory its fairly 
difficult to get around this restriction.
