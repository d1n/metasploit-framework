## Synactis PDF In-The-Box ConnectToSynactic Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synactis' PDF 
In-The-Box ActiveX component, specifically PDF_IN_1.ocx. 
When a long string of data is given to the ConnectToSynactis 
function, which is meant to be used for the ldCmdLine 
argument of a WinExec call, a strcpy routine can end up 
overwriting a TRegistry class pointer saved on the stack, 
resulting in arbitrary code execution under the context of 
the user. Also note that since the WinExec function is used 
to call the default browser, you must be aware that: 1) The 
default must be Internet Explorer, and 2) when the exploit 
runs, another browser will pop up. Synactis PDF In-The-Box 
is also used by other software such as Logic Print 2013, 
which is how the vulnerability was found and publicly 
disclosed.
