## MS10-002 Microsoft Internet Explorer "Aurora" Memory Corruption

This module exploits a memory corruption flaw in Internet 
Explorer. This flaw was found in the wild and was a key 
component of the "Operation Aurora" attacks that lead to the 
compromise of a number of high profile companies. The 
exploit code is a direct port of the public sample published 
to the Wepawet malware analysis site. The technique used by 
this module is currently identical to the public sample, as 
such, only Internet Explorer 6 can be reliably exploited.
