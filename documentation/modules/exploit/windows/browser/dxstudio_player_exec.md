## Worldweaver DX Studio Player shell.execute() Command Execution

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability 
within the DX Studio Player from Worldweaver for versions 
3.0.29 and earlier. The player is a browser plugin for IE 
(ActiveX) and Firefox (dll). When an unsuspecting user 
visits a web page referring to a specially crafted .dxstudio 
document, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands. 
Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.0.29.0 for 
Firefox 2.0.0.20 and IE 6 on Windows XP SP3. In IE, the user 
will be prompted if they wish to allow the plug-in to access 
local files. This prompt appears to occur only once per 
server host. NOTE: This exploit uses additionally dangerous 
script features to write to local files!
