## Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client ActiveX URL Property Download and Execute

This module exploits a vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect 
VPN client vpnweb.ocx ActiveX control. This control is 
typically used to install the VPN client. An attacker can 
set the 'url' property which is where the control tries to 
locate the files needed to install the client. The control 
tries to download two files from the site specified within 
the 'url' property. One of these files it will be stored in 
a temporary directory and executed.
