## Dell Webcam CrazyTalk ActiveX BackImage Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability in Dell Webcam's 
CrazyTalk component. Specifically, when supplying a long 
string for a file path to the BackImage property, an 
overflow may occur after checking certain file extension 
names, resulting in remote code execution under the context 
of the user.
