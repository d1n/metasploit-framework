## Ultra Shareware Office Control ActiveX HttpUpload Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Ultra 
Shareware's Office Control. When processing the 'HttpUpload' 
method, the arguments are concatenated together to form a 
command line to run a bundled version of cURL. If the 
command fails to run, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs 
when building the error message. This is due to the use of 
sprintf() without proper bounds checking. NOTE: Due to input 
restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to get the 
payload into memory unmodified.
