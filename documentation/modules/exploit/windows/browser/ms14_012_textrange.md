## MS14-012 Microsoft Internet Explorer TextRange Use-After-Free

This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability found in 
Internet Explorer. The flaw was most likely introduced in 
2013, therefore only certain builds of MSHTML are affected. 
In our testing with IE9, these vulnerable builds appear to 
be between 9.0.8112.16496 and 9.0.8112.16533, which implies 
the vulnerability shipped between August 2013, when it was 
introduced, until the fix issued in early March 2014.
