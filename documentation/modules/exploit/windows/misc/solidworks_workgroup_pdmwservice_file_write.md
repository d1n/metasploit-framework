## SolidWorks Workgroup PDM 2014 pdmwService.exe Arbitrary File Write

This module exploits a remote arbitrary file write 
vulnerability in SolidWorks Workgroup PDM 2014 SP2 and 
prior. For targets running Windows Vista or newer the 
payload is written to the startup folder for all users and 
executed upon next user logon. For targets before Windows 
Vista code execution can be achieved by first uploading the 
payload as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, 
which schedules WMI to execute the uploaded payload. This 
module has been tested successfully on SolidWorks Workgroup 
PDM 2011 SP0 on Windows XP SP3 (EN) and Windows 7 SP1 (EN).
