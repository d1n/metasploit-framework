## IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express CAD Service Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IBM 
Tivoli Storage Manager Express CAD Service. By sending a 
"ping" packet containing a long string, an attacker can 
execute arbitrary code. NOTE: the dsmcad.exe service must be 
in a particular state (CadWaitingStatus = 1) in order for 
the vulnerable code to be reached. This state doesn't appear 
to be reachable when the TSM server is not running. This 
service does not restart.
