## Firebird Relational Database CNCT Group Number Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability in Firebird SQL Server. 
A specially crafted packet can be sent which will overwrite 
a pointer allowing the attacker to control where data is 
read from. Shortly, following the controlled read, the 
pointer is called resulting in code execution. The 
vulnerability exists with a group number extracted from the 
CNCT information, which is sent by the client, and whose 
size is not properly checked. This module uses an existing 
call to memcpy, just prior to the vulnerable code, which 
allows a small amount of data to be written to the stack. A 
two-phases stackpivot allows to execute the ROP chain which 
ultimately is used to execute VirtualAlloc and bypass DEP.
