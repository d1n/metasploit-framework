## Blue Coat Authentication and Authorization Agent (BCAAA) 5 Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in process 
bcaaa-130.exe (port 16102), which comes as part of the Blue 
Coat Authentication proxy. Please note that by default, this 
exploit will attempt up to three times in order to 
successfully gain remote code execution (in some cases, it 
takes as many as five times). This can cause your activity 
to look even more suspicious. To modify the number of 
exploit attempts, set the ATTEMPTS option.
