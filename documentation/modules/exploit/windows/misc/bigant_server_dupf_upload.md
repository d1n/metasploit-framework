## BigAnt Server DUPF Command Arbitrary File Upload

This exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in 
BigAnt Server 2.97 SP7. A lack of authentication allows to 
make unauthenticated file uploads through a DUPF command. 
Additionally the filename option in the same command can be 
used to launch a directory traversal attack and achieve 
arbitrary file upload. The module uses uses the Windows 
Management Instrumentation service to execute an arbitrary 
payload on vulnerable installations of BigAnt on Windows XP 
and 2003. It has been successfully tested on BigAnt Server 
2.97 SP7 over Windows XP SP3 and 2003 SP2.
