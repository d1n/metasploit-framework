## Android Browser and WebView addJavascriptInterface Code Execution

This module exploits a privilege escalation issue in Android 
< 4.2's WebView component that arises when untrusted 
Javascript code is executed by a WebView that has one or 
more Interfaces added to it. The untrusted Javascript code 
can call into the Java Reflection APIs exposed by the 
Interface and execute arbitrary commands. Some distributions 
of the Android Browser app have an addJavascriptInterface 
call tacked on, and thus are vulnerable to RCE. The Browser 
app in the Google APIs 4.1.2 release of Android is known to 
be vulnerable. A secondary attack vector involves the 
WebViews embedded inside a large number of Android 
applications. Ad integrations are perhaps the worst offender 
here. If you can MITM the WebView's HTTP connection, or if 
you can get a persistent XSS into the page displayed in the 
WebView, then you can inject the html/js served by this 
module and get a shell. Note: Adding a .js to the URL will 
return plain javascript (no HTML markup).
