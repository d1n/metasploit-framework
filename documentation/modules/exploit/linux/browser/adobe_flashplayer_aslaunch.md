## Adobe Flash Player ActionScript Launch Command Execution Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player 
for Linux, version 10.0.12.36 and 9.0.151.0 and prior. An 
input validation vulnerability allows command execution when 
the browser loads a SWF file which contains shell 
metacharacters in the arguments to the ActionScript launch 
method. The victim must have Adobe AIR installed for the 
exploit to work. This module was tested against version 
10.0.12.36 (10r12_36).
