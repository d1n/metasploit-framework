## Poptop Negative Read Overflow

This is an exploit for the Poptop negative read overflow. 
This will work against versions prior to 1.1.3-b3 and 
1.1.3-20030409, but I currently do not have a good way to 
detect Poptop versions. The server will by default only 
allow 4 concurrent manager processes (what we run our code 
in), so you could have a max of 4 shells at once. Using the 
current method of exploitation, our socket will be closed 
before we have the ability to run code, preventing the use 
of Findsock.
