## Pandora FMS Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Pandora FMS 
5.0RC1 and lower. It will leverage an unauthenticated 
command injection in the Anyterm service on port 8023/TCP. 
Commands are executed as the user "pandora". In Pandora FMS 
4.1 and 5.0RC1 the user "artica" is not assigned a password 
by default, which makes it possible to su to this user from 
the "pandora" user. The "artica" user has access to sudo 
without a password, which makes it possible to escalate 
privileges to root. However, Pandora FMS 4.0 and lower force 
a password for the "artica" user during installation.
