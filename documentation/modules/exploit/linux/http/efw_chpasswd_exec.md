## Endian Firewall Proxy Password Change Command Injection

This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability 
in a web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for 
locally-defined proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for 
such an account are required. Command execution will be in 
the context of the "nobody" account, but this account had 
broad sudo permissions, including to run the script 
/usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for 
the Linux root account on the system to the value specified 
by console input once it is executed). The password for the 
proxy user account specified will *not* be changed by the 
use of this module, as long as the target system is 
vulnerable to the exploit. Very early versions of Endian 
Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require HTTP basic auth credentials 
as well to exploit this vulnerability. Use the USERNAME and 
PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values if 
required. Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable 
code, but it appears to never be executed due to a bug in 
the vulnerable CGI script which also prevents normal use 
(http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002). Versions 2.3.x and 
2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug 
(http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083). 
Tested successfully against the following versions of EFW 
Community: 1.1 RC5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5.1, 2.5.2. Should 
function against any version from 1.1 RC5 to 2.2.x, as well 
as 2.4.1 and 2.5.x.
