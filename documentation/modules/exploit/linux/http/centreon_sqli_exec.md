## Centreon SQL and Command Injection

This module exploits several vulnerabilities on Centreon 
2.5.1 and prior and Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2 and 
prior. Due to a combination of SQL injection and command 
injection in the displayServiceStatus.php component, it is 
possible to execute arbitrary commands as long as there is a 
valid session registered in the centreon.session table. In 
order to have a valid session, all it takes is a successful 
login from anybody. The exploit itself does not require any 
authentication. This module has been tested successfully on 
Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2.
