## V-CMS PHP File Upload and Execute

This module exploits a vulnerability found on V-CMS's inline 
image upload feature. The problem is due to the 
inline_image_upload.php file not checking the file type 
before saving it on the web server. This allows any 
malicious user to upload a script (such as PHP) without 
authentication, and then execute it with a GET request. The 
issue is fixed in 1.1 by checking the extension name. By 
default, 1.1 only allows jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, but it is 
still possible to upload a PHP file as one of those 
extension names, which may still be leveraged in an attack.
