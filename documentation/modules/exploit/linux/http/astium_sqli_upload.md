## Astium Remote Code Execution

This module exploits vulnerabilities found in Astium 
astium-confweb-2.1-25399 RPM and lower. A SQL Injection 
vulnerability is used to achieve authentication bypass and 
gain admin access. From an admin session arbitrary PHP code 
upload is possible. It is used to add the final PHP payload 
to "/usr/local/astium/web/php/config.php" and execute the 
"sudo /sbin/service astcfgd reload" command to reload the 
configuration and achieve remote root code execution.
