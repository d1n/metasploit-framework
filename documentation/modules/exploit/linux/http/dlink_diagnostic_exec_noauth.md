## D-Link DIR-645 / DIR-815 diagnostic.php Command Execution

Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection 
in the web interface. On DIR-645 versions prior 1.03 
authentication isn't needed to exploit it. On version 1.03 
authentication is needed in order to trigger the 
vulnerability, which has been fixed definitely on version 
1.04. Other D-Link products, like DIR-300 rev B and DIR-600, 
are also affected by this vulnerability. Not every device 
includes wget which we need for deploying our payload. On 
such devices you could use the cmd generic payload and try 
to start telnetd or execute other commands. Since it is a 
blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output 
for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. 
A ping command against a controlled system could be used for 
testing purposes. This module has been tested successfully 
on DIR-645 prior to 1.03, where authentication isn't needed 
in order to exploit the vulnerability.
