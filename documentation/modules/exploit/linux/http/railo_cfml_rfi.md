## Railo Remote File Include

This module exploits a remote file include vulnerability in 
Railo, tested against version 4.2.1. First, a call using a 
vulnerable <cffile> line in thumbnail.cfm allows an atacker 
to download an arbitrary PNG file. By appending a .cfm, and 
taking advantage of a directory traversal, an attacker can 
append cold fusion markup to the PNG file, and have it 
interpreted by the server. This is used to stage and execute 
a fully-fledged payload.
