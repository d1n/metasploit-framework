## Mutiny 5 Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits a code execution flaw in the Mutiny 5 
appliance. The EditDocument servlet provides a file upload 
function to authenticated users. A directory traversal 
vulnerability in the same functionality allows for arbitrary 
file upload, which results in arbitrary code execution with 
root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a 
valid user (any role) in the web frontend is required. The 
module has been tested successfully on the Mutiny 5.0-1.07 
appliance.
