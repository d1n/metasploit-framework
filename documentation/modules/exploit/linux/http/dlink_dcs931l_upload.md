## D-Link DCS-931L File Upload

This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in D-Link 
DCS-931L network cameras. The setFileUpload functionality 
allows authenticated users to upload files to anywhere on 
the file system, allowing system files to be overwritten, 
resulting in execution of arbitrary commands. This module 
has been tested successfully on a D-Link DCS-931L with 
firmware versions 1.01_B7 (2013-04-19) and 1.04_B1 
(2014-04-21). D-Link DCS-930L, DCS-932L, DCS-933L models are 
also reportedly affected, but untested.
