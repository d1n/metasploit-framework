## Sun Solaris sadmind adm_build_path() Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in 
adm_build_path() function of sadmind daemon. The distributed 
system administration daemon (sadmind) is the daemon used by 
Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed 
system administration operations. The sadmind daemon is 
started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a request 
to invoke an operation is received. The sadmind daemon 
process continues to run for 15 minutes after the last 
request is completed, unless a different idle-time is 
specified with the -i command line option. The sadmind 
daemon may be started independently from the command line, 
for example, at system boot time. In this case, the -i 
option has no effect; sadmind continues to run, even if 
there are no active requests.
