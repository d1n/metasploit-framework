## Mac OS X NFS Mount Privilege Escalation Exploit

This exploit leverages a stack overflow vulnerability to 
escalate privileges. The vulnerable function 
nfs_convert_old_nfs_args does not verify the size of a 
user-provided argument before copying it to the stack. As a 
result, by passing a large size as an argument, a local user 
can overwrite the stack with arbitrary content. Mac OS X 
Lion Kernel <= xnu-1699.32.7 except xnu-1699.24.8 are 
affected.
