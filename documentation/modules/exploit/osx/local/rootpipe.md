## Apple OS X Rootpipe Privilege Escalation

This module exploits a hidden backdoor API in Apple's Admin 
framework on Mac OS X to escalate privileges to root, dubbed 
"Rootpipe." This module was tested on Yosemite 10.10.2 and 
should work on previous versions. The patch for this issue 
was not backported to older releases. Note: you must run 
this exploit as an admin user to escalate to root.
