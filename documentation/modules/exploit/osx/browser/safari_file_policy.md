## Apple Safari file:// Arbitrary Code Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple Safari 
on OS X platform. A policy issue in the handling of file:// 
URLs may allow arbitrary remote code execution under the 
context of the user. In order to trigger arbitrary remote 
code execution, the best way seems to be opening a share on 
the victim machine first (this can be SMB/WebDav/FTP, or a 
fileformat that OS X might automount), and then execute it 
in /Volumes/[share]. If there's some kind of bug that leaks 
the victim machine's current username, then it's also 
possible to execute the payload in 
/Users/[username]/Downloads/, or else bruteforce your way to 
getting that information. Please note that non-java payloads 
(*.sh extension) might get launched by Xcode instead of 
executing it, in that case please try the Java ones instead.
