## AppleFileServer LoginExt PathName Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the 
AppleFileServer service on MacOS X. This vulnerability was 
originally reported by Atstake and was actually one of the 
few useful advisories ever published by that company. You 
only have one chance to exploit this bug. This particular 
exploit uses a stack-based return address that will only 
work under optimal conditions.
