# CVE-2015-6127 File Generation Documentation

This documentation explains how the recordset file and the cab files are generated for the
CVE-2015-6127 exploit.

## The recordset Directory

The recordset file is needed so that when the exploit uses the ADODB.Recordset API, it can properly
download, open, and save our file.

* recordsetdata.txt

This is the file that will be converted to a recordset file. Make sure there's no quote around the
src attribute, otherwise that will get mangled by the ADODB.Recordset API.

* generator.hta

You must run this file under Windows, and that will convert recordsetdata.txt into a recordset
file (named recordset.txt).

## The cab Directory

The cab archive is used to host our malicious INF file, which contains instructions about how to
execute our payload.

* create_cab.bat

This script will generate our cab file for us including the INF file. If you want, you can rebuild
the cab with a signed one, so Windows won't show a security prompt due to an unsafe ActiveX.

* .inf

This contains instructions on how to execute our payload.
